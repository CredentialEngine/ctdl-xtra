# Semantic similarity between two texts

LLMs used by xTRA seem to perform well on extracting the requested information however they rarely extract it exactly the same. We observe higher variations in more ambiguous sources such as when aiming for Credential descriptions which are often expressed alongside program descriptions in the same paragraphs or sections. The resulting variation seems to be semantically stable however it is difficult to assert correctness with absolute methods - such as the ones we currently use in our automated test harness. This renders our testing less useful which also makes it difficult to maintain the quality of our extractions as we keep developing the system. One solution to this could be to use [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between the factors represented by their embedding vectors as this should yield a semantic comparison which might be sufficient to assert that all extraction variations tends toward the same semantic center of gravity. OpenAI provides a model that generates the vectors from textual content, [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

In this document we explore the feasibility of using the embeddings for our test harness and we expose a few example to provide an understanding of what degree of similarity is achieved by this method. The main topics of interest will be:
  - Comparison examples to determine a equality threshold
  - Cost
  - Time required to get the embeddings from OpenAI, our tests see increasing in coverage which could lead to long test executions

## Conclusions

### Observations

- The cosine similarity seems to be good tool to assert similarity between extracted and expected information
- The costs using `text-embedding-3-small` is very small (see below)
- Con: Missing words from one of the terms does not impact the coefficient which could be undesirable if applications required that it the assertions ensure no information is missing
- Tooling for using cosine similarity embeddings vectors has been added to the project with an example test at: [../server/tests/extractions/credentials/embeddings.test.ts](../server/tests/extractions/credentials/embeddings.test.ts)

While it might not be a definitive answer for longer worded terms it can be one of the composite KPIs used to assert precision of the model. Combined with word saliency evaluation between the terms we could answer the question that the bodies of text are both close semantically and discuss the same key concepts.

### Cost estimation

Total tokens used for the title examples: 193 total with an average of 8,7 tokens per entry.
Total tokens used for the description examples: 1198 with an average of 63 per entry.

Currently we have 14 tests, each with an average of 4 extraction tests, each test asserting 1 title and 1 description. Cost could be estimated as follows:

```MATH
14 * 4 = 56
```

```MATH
56 * 8.7 = 461.1
```
```MATH
56 * 63 = 3528
```
```MATH

Tokens = 3528+461.1 = 3989.1
```
At the time of writing (Jul. 2025), the `text-embedding-3-small` embeddings model has a price of $0.02/per 1M token, a test run could cost around $0,000079
