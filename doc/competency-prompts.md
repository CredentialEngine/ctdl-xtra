# Competency Prompts

### Detection of skills and potential pages

```
Is there direct information of the skills or competencies obtained after taking the course? Generate a JSON object having property "containsCompetencies" with true or false based on if there is direct information in the markdown. The value should be false if we need to follow another link to get the direct information. In the output also add a property called potentialUrls that is an array of the URLs to pages that could present information about the skills or competencies obtained after the course. Do not hallucinate or make up any information anything returned should be contained in the attached page. Output ONLY JSON.

Example output:

```JSON
{
  "containsCompetencies": false,
  "potentialUrls": [
    "https://www.indstate.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors/psychology",
    "content.php?catoid=60&navoid=3204"
  ]
}
```

Issues:
- Additional URL, not useful but it did find the actual URL


### Extracting competencies

Prompt

```
Output a list of skills acquired related to "Critical Thinking" in the attached page. All information has to be exactly present in the page, do not hallucinate any information. If there are no skills in the page, output an empty list. Output only JSON.
